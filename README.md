# Binary String Reinforcement Learning #
This is a personal project to learn more about reinforcement learning inspired by OpenAI's paper [Hindsight Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01495.pdf). In this pedagogical task, an agent must perform bit flipping actions to transform a given binary string to a given target string with only sparse rewards.

This repo allows one to replicate the results found in the paper and adjust virtual goal parameters for better performance.
