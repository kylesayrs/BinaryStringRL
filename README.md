# Binary String Q-Learning #
This is a personal project to learn more about reinforcement learning. In this task, an agent must perform bit flipping actions to transform a given binary string to a given target string.

This project also aims to implement and replicate the results found in OpenAI's paper on [Hindsight Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01495.pdf)
